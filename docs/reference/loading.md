# Loading

Functions to load the logged data from experiments and their repetitions and the structure of the generated experiments.

The functions can be accessed under the module: ``exputils.data``

Usually the data is loaded in Jupyter notebook using the [`ExperimentDataLoaderWidget`](../visualization/#exputils.gui.jupyter.experiment_data_loader_widget.ExperimentDataLoaderWidget).
The following loading functions can be used if data should be loaded for a custom analysis or plots.
