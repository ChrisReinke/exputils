# Welcome to Exputils

Version: `0.3.8`

The Experiment Utilities (exputils) contain various tools for the management of scientific experiments and their experimental data. 
It is especially designed to handle experimental repetitions, including to run different repetitions, to effectively store and load data for them, and to visualize their results.

_Main features:_

 - Easy definition of default configurations using nested python dictionaries.
 - Setup of experimental configuration parameters with an ODS file for [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (open-source alternative to MS Excel).
 - Running experiments and their repetitions in parallel.
 - Logging of experimental data (numpy, json) with tensorboard support.
 - Loading and filtering of experimental data.
 - Interactive Jupyter widgets to load, select and plot data as line, box and bar plots.
